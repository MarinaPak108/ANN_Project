## Project

This project was developed within the framework of study AI. The main point was to provide data analysis and data preprocessing in pipelines along with ML and ANN models development.

Project Goal: predict the net hourly electrical energy output of the combined cycle powerplant plant.

Role in Project: Worked 30 hours a week (overall 3 weeks) as a data analyst within a team of 2 to produce visualizations of collected data from a Combined Cycle Power Plant and developed ANN model.

### About_Dataset
The dataset contains 9568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011), when the power plant was set to work with full load. Features consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of the plant.

A combined cycle power plant (CCPP) is composed of gas turbines (GT), steam turbines (ST) and heat recovery steam generators. In a CCPP, the electricity is generated by gas and steam turbines, which are combined in one cycle, and is transferred from one turbine to another. While the Vacuum is collected from and has effect on the Steam Turbine, he other three of the ambient variables effect the GT performance.

*   [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - to analyze results
*   [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org) - for developing artificial neural network

### Algorithms

*   [Lasso](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.Lasso.html) - Linear Model trained with L1 prior as regularizer (aka the Lasso)
*   [SVR](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVR.html) - Epsilon-Support Vector Regression
*   [DecisionTreeRegressor](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html) - creates a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features
*   [RandomForestRegressor](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html)  - meta estimator that fits a number of classifying decision trees on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting
*   [GradientBoostingRegressor](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor.html) - estimator builds an additive model in a forward stage-wise fashion, where in each stage a regression tree is fit on the negative gradient of the given loss function
*   Artificial neural networks - Artificial neural network (ANN) is a computational model that consists of several processing elements that receive inputs and deliver outputs based on their predefined activation functions.(1)
